We'll accomplish this by creating a `SGD` object and setting learning rate, decay, and momentum parameters at initialization.  In this way, we can then pass in the `SGD` object we've initialized to our specificataions during the compile step, rather than just a string representing an off-the-shelf `'SGD'`  optimizer.  \n",
